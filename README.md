# Island of Golocans Chrome Theme
Make the fictional Island of Golocans your home in Chrome.

The Island of Golocans has four very unique characteristics. The West has an abundance of sweet fruits, green hills and plenty of trees for some shade during peak summer. Apparently, the North of this island has some hidden gold coins near a lighthouse. In this region, one might spot plenty of starfish, too. 

The East coast is notorious for invading pirates - not all of them make it through the rough seas, though. The few that make it have to then climb up very uncomfortable rocks and only then will they be able to enter this island. 

Finally, the South Island, which is also known as Golifish, is connected with a wooden bridge. This region is very popular with voyagers who often come here and leave notes in glass bottles for future readers. They often also leave items of significance, like a compass, for guiding their journey to this island. 

Have a pleasant time exploring this island!
